## Key Features:

Upload PDF documents for analysis

Ask questions in natural language about the uploaded content

Dynamic display of the LLM model used for answering

Responsive React frontend styled with Material-UI

Flask backend API serving health checks, file upload, and question answering endpoints

Dockerized setup for easy development and deployment
